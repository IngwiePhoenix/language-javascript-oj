# OJ Atom syntax highlighting

A throw-together version of a Syntax Highlighting scheme for Github's Atom.

It's based off the definition for Objective-J, which in terms was converted from a TextMate bundle.

If you could make this more serious, or give me a hand in making that, please let me know, thanks! ^.^
